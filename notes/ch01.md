# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Target of Survival Analysis
- Since perfect controlled trial cannot be guaranteed 
- Need techniques to extract information from incomplete data

## Survival Data and Censoring
- response 
  - non-negative discrete/continuous R.V.
  - representing time from **well-defined origin** to **well-defined event**

- censoring
  - starting/ending events are not precisely observed
  - e.g.
    - right censoring: $T = min(T^*, U)$
    - $T^*$: time to failure
    - $U$: time to censoring event
  - $\delta = I[T^* < U]$: indicator for censoring
  - Types
    - Type I: ended at time pre-specified
    - Type II: ended at pre-specified fraction of sample have failed
    - Type III: random censoring 
      - e.g. patient dropout
